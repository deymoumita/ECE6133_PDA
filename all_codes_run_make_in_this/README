Polish Expression Floorplanning : Simulated Annealing
Created by Anirudha Kurhade and Moumita Dey for ECE6133 Physical Design Automation

File list:

* All .h files are the header files for their .cc counterparts
* Please refer to the .h files for description of functions or variables as they have been defined and described in the .h files itself

Floorplan.cc - The top most file containing the call for the algorithm to be executed, takes input command line arguments
Algorithms.h/.cc - Contains the main function calls to the different aspects of the program, i.e. read file, create initial polish expression, call simulated annealing and stockmeyer algorithm, open GUI
Readfile.h/.cc - Parses the input benchmark file and converts useful data into appropriate data structures to be fed to the program
DrawFloorplan.h/.cc - OpenGL code to display the GUI
PE.h/.cc - Contains major functions pertaining to the PE data structure; simulated annealing and stockmeyer algorithms
Node.h/.cc - The lowest file in hierarchary that contains data structures for each element (operator/operand) in the PE

Output files generated:
polish.txt - contains module details after each stage in the algorithm which is used by DrawFloorplan.cc to display GUI

benchmarks folder:
Contains the provided benchmarks on the website. Also contains a small test case under test.fp


Makefile:
make clean - clean all executables
make - make all headers

Running instructions:
first make as -
	make
	
To run, use format - 
	./Floorplan <algorithm_type> <option> <file_path>
	
	where <algorithm_type> can be-
		SA - Simulated Annealing
		SASM - Simulated annealing followed by stockmeyer algorithm
		SM - Stockmeyer algorithm
	options 0 to 5 are shortcuts to existing benchmarks- 
		0 = test.fp
		1 = fft.fp
		2 = industry.fp
		3 = mult.fp
		4 = processor.fp
		5 = rca.fp
	option 6 is to specify user specified benchmark with <file_path> as path of the file
	
	eg:
		./Floorplan SASM 6 benchmarks/fft.fp
		
		will run simulated annealing and stockmeyer as post processing on the file fft.fp present in benchmarks folder
		
		./Floorplan SA 1
		
		will run only the simulated annealing algorithm on the already present file fft.fp  
		
****IMPORTANT****
Please make sure to ssh into ecelinsrvx as ssh -XY to invoke X11 forwarding, else it will give freeglut errors of not being able to open the display
